# toilet-rater-frontend
### An app to allow users to rate bathrooms in public spaces and view ratings by others.

### MVP plan:
- The main thing is Next.js, because routing is easier
- A basic review consists of a number 0.5-5.0 (star rating) for 3 categories (aesthetics, cleanliness, and experience), the name of the toilets reviewed, an optional grid reference (later to be assigned under-the-hood using Google Maps or some other method), a username (or anonymous) and a text comment.
- The name of the toilets reviewed can be put into a database, and brought back by backend API to let users quickly select it and avoid duplication.
- A basic toilet profile generated by dynamic routing - include name, optional grid reference, average rating.
- Put the backend on Node, but the database on Couchbase, so I can do the task for Perry Krug

### Little stretch goals:
- Add cost information for toilet profile
- Add female/male specific or everyone for toilet profile (or perhaps review)
- Add authentication to reduce troll/astroturf tactics
- Add image uploading support

### Research:
- The 'toiletinspector.com' site rates toilets by ODOUR, CLEANLINESS, RUNNING WATER, HAND WASH, TOILET PAPER, HAND DRYER, FLOOR STATE, OVERALL SCORE
